thoughts on program:

-currently appears that the command to open a stream from /dev/graphics/fb0 is not working
	->might be able to call a c function which could map framebuffer to memory, and then memcopy
		the fb0 into a passed in array from java, and either return number of bytes copied, or
		assume it copied all of them

	->might just be calling the function incorrectly, or don't have proper permissions
	
->command starting working, not sure why exactly. Did do chmod 777 on /dev/graphics/fb0 again, but not sure if reason.

-new issue:  was expecting fb0 to be continually read as a stream, turns out it is only being read once (736px*1280px*3screens*4bytes/px=11304960bytes)
		which is the exact amount being written out before -1 is returned by is.write()

	->could either try getting this data from a native call through jni to a c function that has memory mapped fb0, 
		or could maybe try reopening stream or something


other issues:
-seems that sometimes the broadcaster will try to receive, and the receiver will try to broadcast

-wifi direct connection should be closed at somepoint, creates weird before if connection is established before app is running
